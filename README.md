# Fifteen puzzle#

This is a classic 15-puzzle, one of the world’s most recognized and popular brainteasers.

### Details ###

The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many
others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order
with one tile missing.

The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order, by making sliding moves that use the 
empty space.

### Why I wrote this app? ###

I have been "away" from programming for a while, due to several factors and reasons, such 
as (1) birth of my son (who is almost 5 years old now), (2) moving to a new country, 
(3) learning a new (Dutch) language and studying for obligatory integration exams. 

At the moment I'm "refreshing" my knowledge and skills. Writing apps like this seems 
the best way to do so.

I have a bachelor degree in Software Engineering, Master's degree in Information 
Technologies and work experience using C#/.NET, Adobe LifeCycle and JavaScript. 
See my CV for a full list of my knowledge set and skills.

If you are a company looking for (female) developers in Groningen area (the Netherlands),
